## Synopsis 
This is a collection of Python scripts that can be used in various ways to browse reddit. 

They can be used indivdually or all accessed in a CLI interface provided through cli_reddit_broswer.py 

## Motiviation 
I wanted to make a fun/interesting way to browse one of my favorite websites. 

you can add aliases to your bashrc, zshrc, etc. for ease of use. For example: 
* alias reddit='python cli_reddit_browser.py'

## Dependencies 
This was made with Python3 using the Reddit praw and prawcore APIs.

User should supply their own client_id, client_secret, user_agent, password, and username. Steps for how to acquire these can found in the PRAW documentation.
